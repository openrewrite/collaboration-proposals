# Collaboration proposals

At OpenRewrite we invite anyone to [contribute to our projects](https://github.com/openrewrite/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#ways-to-contribute).

Collaborations allow us to work closely together with other communities, and provide write access to our repositories to trusted members of those communities.
We already collaborate with [many organizations and individuals](https://github.com/orgs/openrewrite/repositories?q=&type=public&language=&sort=stargazers), and we're always looking for new communities to work together.

If you would like to propose a collaboration with OpenRewrite, please [fill out the following information](https://github.com/openrewrite/collaboration-proposals/issues/new/choose).
